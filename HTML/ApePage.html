            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>Ape In Space was a collaborative effort between me and four team members to design and program a game in
            the MonoGame C# framework over a period of several weeks. Ape In Space is a top-down, limited-resource shoot-em-up involving waves of aliens 
            that target your location amidst an asteroid field. The game's central mechanic is the singular rubber duck you use as a weapon. The physics 
            of the duck allows it to bounce right back into your hand at a certain distance, encouraging close-up action. Your player also moves faster 
            when they are not holding the duck, making ranged hit-and-run tactics viable as well. The player is targeted by three waves of aliens, comprised
            of the big and beefy blues, the fast and furious yellows, and the mean greens. Defeat these waves, and you will live to be an ape in space 
            another day. If the horde is too much for your duck to handle, you may find yourself adrift amongst the cosmos.
            In working as a developer on this project, I honed skills in principles of C#, modeling physics, utilizing data structures, 
            and creating engaging gameplay loops from scratch. My team was comprised of extremely effective coders who I learned a great deal from, 
            and this project was excellent as a result.</p>
