            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>Beat Your Fears was produced in a single weekend for the RIT professor-hosted Roll Your Fate Game Jam, in which
                individual teams were given specifications for creative constraints according to dicerolls. Beat Your Fears is a Unity-programmed arcade game in which
                the player has to time their strikes against various beasts, speeding up as it goes along. If you fail to attack within the timing window,
                you lose a life, which eventually results in a loss after three. Though it may seem initially viable to hammer the spacebar relentlessly,
                the pace at which the game eventually progresses makes anything but the most precise timing ultimately fail. Working on this project was
                a lesson in the Unity Engine, high level programmatic design in C#, and maintaining solo and group workflows under relentless time crush.</p>
