            <p>Every day I aim to go through life with an open heart, an open mind, and both feet forward (at regular alternating intervals). My body of
               work and area of specialization lies in C# systems programming in the MonoGame Framework and Unity Engine. I am a competent programmer and
               2D artist for most purposes across C#, HTML, JS, and CSS. In the conceptual phases of projects, I am a master of getting things started,
               striving to engage members of my team and create all-encompassing ideation. Though I am but a humble fledgling in this nebulous industry,
               one thing I can always promise is my willingness to learn, desire to improve, and focus on excellence. For a top-to-bottom dedication to the 
               project, Cortland Lehnen is the one you want on your team.
